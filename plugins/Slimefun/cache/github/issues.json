Once when you put on the armor and quickly wear on a different leather armor (even custom one), it's recolored then too. This mess up with other armors and especially custom armors, cuz these needs specific colors to work.\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Put on rainbow chestplate or any other part\r\n2. Take it off\r\n3. Quickly put on basic leather armor, it's recolored.\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nDo not recolor other armors.\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/assets/75527300/2747fa92-b06d-4bb2-90ea-638b79cc5491\r\n\r\n\n\n### 📜 Server Log\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### 💻 Server Software\n\nPaper\n\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\n\n1.19.x\n\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\n\nSlimefun version DEV - 1087 (git dc22e665)\n\n### 🧭 Other plugins\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3931/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3929","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3929/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3929/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3929/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3929","id":1827890358,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATMVe85WuyNC","number":3929,"title":"exploded sf blocks now drop their sf item","user":{"login":"iTwins","id":48769316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzY5MzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48769316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins","html_url":"https://github.com/iTwins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2683827702,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjgzODI3NzAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%E2%9C%A8%20Fix","name":"✨ Fix","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"This Pull Request fixes an issue."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2023-07-30T10:49:39Z","updated_at":"2023-08-05T21:12:25Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pulls/3929","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3929","diff_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3929.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3929.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"## Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nSlimefun blocks didn't drop when exploded because the ``drops`` argument in ``BlockBreakHandler::onExplode`` did nothing.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n<!-- Please explain what changes you have made to the code. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n~~Pass the ``SlimefunItem`` to the ``handleEplosion`` method in ``ExplosionsListener.java`` and drop the item there.~~\r\n\r\n~~Other changes:~~\r\n~~Removed unused import.~~\r\n\r\n~~I didn't change the method signature for ``BlockBreakHandler::onExplode`` since it's a public method and that seemed like a bad idea to change.~~\r\n\r\nEDIT: Changed approach completely.

Description\r\nI have recently run into an issue where a world, when created quickly enough after deletion of a world with the same name, will not store data. I have tested this extensively and narrowed the issue down to [this](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/thebusybiscuit/slimefun4/implementation/tasks/TickerTask.java#L102) ticker code and [this](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/src/main/java/me/mrCookieSlime/Slimefun/api/BlockStorage.java#L116) check for the world's existence. Since the ticker code only runs every half second, it does not remove the world from the registry until up to a Slimefun tick later and therefore causes issues in the constructor.\r\n\r\nAn easy way to recreate this issue is to delete a world and immediately create a new one with the same name.\r\n\r\nFull credits go to @gecko10000 for some reason (my git skills most likely) his PR got closed while i tried to update it.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nThis PR changes the registry to use UUIDs instead of the world names themselves. This _does not_ affect the storage location in files and therefore these are not breaking changes.\r\n\r\nThis may not be the ideal way to do it; it may be better to remove the world from the registry [here](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/thebusybiscuit/slimefun4/implementation/listeners/WorldListener.java#L28) instead.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\nNo issue opened\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\ncreatePreset is a very useful function when writing addons, it allows us to not worry about re-writing the canOpen method that handles block permissions. The only downside for common use is that you can't bind menu click events easily since there's no support for newInstance without actually creating your own BlockMenuPreset instance directly. The problem with that is you must then overwrite canOpen yourself too - which is dangerous as an Addon developer. There are reasons you might want  to do that still (such as private machines only the placer can open), but for generic use it feels quite dangerous since responding to inventory clicks is quite a common use when you add custom functionality like collecting a non-item resource manually from machines (such as XP, or maybe money)\r\n\r\nThere is probably a much better way of doing this, it's more a \"proof of concept\" so I didn't worry too much about formatting being messed up or fully testing this.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n<!-- Please explain what changes you have made to the code. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nAn additional override for createPreset that allows passing a function to newInstance directly, thus negating the downsides for most common uses of createPreset.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n<!-- Please tag any Issues related to your Pull Request -->\r\n<!-- Syntax: \"Resolves #000\" -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

If you have Slimefun item that is placable (+more, tried it with machines, cargo, solar panels, backpacks) in your main hand, it plants a seed which after destroying drops the item that was in your hand. I asked Vehicles support and they found out that the error causing it is probably line 80. I am sending some messages from him:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19331474/218342787-f9cf8547-8f93-4959-80eb-c95802684c0c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19331474/218342790-c80efdfa-cc01-4c27-b1b0-7468d9eac6c2.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19331474/218342799-2b04763a-0e3a-4cbe-b8e5-3f058abae69f.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19331474/218342803-e8a56951-59bb-4bc9-9e46-d71a83d96bee.png)\r\n\r\n(Server is running on Waterfall - Yatopia)\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Ride a tractor\r\n2. Put in seeds\r\n3. Put the Slimefun item in your main hand\r\n4. Ride over farmland\r\n5. Destroy the seed (doesn’t have to be grown)\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nIt shouldn’t interfere with what you are planting, it should plant the item that is in the vehicle trunk.\n\n### 📷 Screenshots

This command just collects the blocks held in BlockStorage into a single file denoting the item ID and the amount held in storage.\r\n\r\nRecently many servers have had issues with BlockStorage and a simple fix (for some) has been to show them just how many of a certain block they have to allow them to triage and tackle the amount. This has been very positive for servers with ExoticGarden where they have had upwards of millions of several of plants which, when they purged them, released a not insignificant amount of RAM. \r\n\r\nUntil now I have just offered this command as a separate JAR to server owners having issues and worked through the resolution with them but I think it makes sense to have the command here, regardless of the few use-cases.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nAdd a new command that dumps contents into a file.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"642\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20646323/211083935-a495b0c0-1e59-4bce-af01-384d03f6c123.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"661\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20646323/211083985-afcb2a33-0fdf-45ff-98da-59ce68c23b11.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"537\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20646323/211081434-9668fd86-886a-4e52-ae25-9244a7762180.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"300\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20646323/211084043-f06538f4-8f33-4930-b916-f4161d13d7af.png\">\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n<!-- Please tag any Issues related to your Pull Request -->\r\n<!-- Syntax: \"Resolves #000\" -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

The bug is that SF electricity generators are changing to vanilla items, but all items can change this way based on the code from the error I'm posting below. \r\n\r\nPlease fix this as soon as possible, this is a very serious bug as players may start to abuse it and ask us to replace a vanilla block with an op generator, but the block was never a generator.\r\n\r\n\n\n### 📑 Reproduction

Description\r\nThis isn't directly for Slimefun. Many addons have blocks that display information about their current operational status within a GUI inventory. While this is a good way to do this from the player's perspective, this creates a BlockMenu that is kept in RAM indefinitely which has recently been the cause of some issues. While the block storage rewrite will likely be the best 'fix' for this, for now this is to allow addons to remove information-only GUIs for their machines.\r\n\r\nThe biggest 'offender' for this is InfinityExpansion which in my most recent example server had 70k~ of these inventories which are, effectively, wasting RAM - and a lot of it.\r\nIf accepted I will be using this in Infinity, Networks and Tinker and will recommend to any other addons with similar blocks.\r\n\r\nThis solution will allow addons to display the information they are trying to put forward through the MultiMeter\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nAdd a new ItemAttribute that addons can implement to add additional messages to the MultiMeter.\r\n\r\nThis could easily be a new tool instead. While I think it fits well in the MultiMeter, I'm happy to make a new item for this purpose.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

This only happens to Slimefun blocks, vanilla blocks will drop just fine. Also this seems to clear block storage data on that coordinate as well.\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Enable `call-explosive-event` on explosive pickaxe\r\n2. Try to break Slimefun blocks\r\n3. See it only drops the one you are hitting with it\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\nIt should drop all the Slimefun blocks\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\nhttps://youtu.be/OG7TwUCqqzg\n\n### 📜 Server

The main problem I need to fix, is actually fact that players are able to enchant mmoitems witch blocked use in enchanting tables or anvils in sf autoenchanters. in. My items are blocked against enchanting but in sf you can simply bypass it. I know there's a way to add blocked lore. But what about old items without that lore? A lot of of my players using items without this lore.\r\n\r\nSo what I need to add ?\r\nEasily check stats from mmoitem and if it has blocked using in crafting, enchanting.., it won't be possible to upgrade this item. This will be probably better than using lores, because it will apply to all items no matter how old those items are.\r\n\r\nLet me know, if it is possible, thanks and have a good day!\r\n\r\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nCreate an mmoitem and block it's interaction in enchanting tables/anvils.\r\nAdd this item to slimefun autoenchanter.\r\nYou can add this item there.\r\n\r\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nMMOItems with blocked features like using them in enchanting tables, they should not be usable in sf as well.\r\n\r\n### 📷 Screenshots /

📔 Introduction\r\nOver the last few months and years you all have often requested for us to be more open in regards to upcoming changes.\r\nSo we decided its time to finally release a proper roadmap.\r\nNote here that this roadmap will never be complete and final, we may add or change some goals from time to time and we will refrain from setting a release date for things until absolutely certain.\r\n\r\nThis simply serves as a rough guide for you to see what changes you can be excited about.\r\nMany of those changes will likely be of technical nature though, so they may not be as exciting or intesting at first.\r\n\r\nAlso, we aren't actively looking for pull requests towards these goals unless explicitly requested.\r\nIf you wish to make a pull request, choose any open issue or approved suggestion and you are more than welcome :heart:\r\nThese changes however are mainly targeted towards the core team.\r\n\r\n## ⭐ Upcoming changes\r\nSome of these milestones will have a date assigned to them.\r\nBut the majority of milestones are still to far away to even have a date ready here.\r\nThose are marked as *TBD* (to be decided).\r\n\r\n| Symbol | Type of change |\r\n| :---: | :------- |\r\n| 🔧 | Technical change / API |\r\n| 🎈 | New Features |\r\n| 💡 | Performance improvements |\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Older changes</summary>\r\n\r\n### 🔧 ~~(September 3rd - 6th 2021) API relocation~~ - **DONE**\r\nThe first upcoming change is a major relocation of some of our classes to unify some packages, get rid of old classpaths and to follow the general conventions. You can read more about this here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3139\r\n\r\n### 🔧 ~~(Q3 2022) Updating to Java 16~~\r\nSlimefun will update to Java 16.\r\nYou can see the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3602\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### 🎈(Q3 2022) New sound-system\r\nSoon we will allow server owners to fully configure any sound in this plugin.\r\nThis will also work with custom sounds from resource packs. Additionally you can change the pitch and volume of any sound or even mute it.\r\nYou can see the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2844\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (2023) Inventory system rewrite\r\nNext up is a rewrite for our inventory-system. The API is very rusty and aged. We don't have an ETA yet, perhaps closely after or along with the aforementioned API relocation.\r\nThe new system will be much more flexible and easier to use for developers.\r\n\r\n### 🎈 (2023) Changes to the radiation system\r\nThanks to @Semisol you will soon be able to enjoy a new radiation system which works by calculating a so-called \"exposure level\" to a radioactive substance. You won't experience radiation symptoms until a certain exposure level has been reached.\r\nThis will also make the different radiation levels much more distinct from each other and the features comes with a few good-looking UI changes too! You can track the progress of that here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3189\r\n\r\n### 🎈 (2023) SQL database support and Research system rewrite\r\nThe Research system will be rewritten api-wise.\r\nWe will also drop numeric ids for researches and solely rely on namespaced keys.\r\nIn addition to this, we will add support for SQL databases to sync researches across multiple servers.\r\nAlternatively, a local file-based database can be used.\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (2023) Recipe system rewrite\r\nOur recipe system is in deep need of a rewrite, it needs to be much less item-comparison based and we should allow alternate ingredients through the use of material tags or slimefun item classes and such.\r\nI will be doing this rewrite myself and some infrastructure has been set up already but nothing to show you yet, it is still a while until we get there.\r\n\r\n### 🎈 (2023) Programmable androids rewrite\r\nProgrammable androids are great.\r\nBut they can be better! We will be stripping the data of an android from its block and give it a unique identity instead.\r\nThe UI will be completely redone and it will have much better performance. Oh, and you will be able to give other players access to your android and configure their permissions.\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (TBD) Ticker rewrite\r\nThanks to @LinoxGH and @md5sha256 our ticker system will be rewritten to be much more reliable.\r\nThis will also include some API changes that are yet to be added, you can track the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2996\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (TBD) BlockStorage system rewrite\r\nThe \"block-storage\" system will be rewritten, the API will change drastically and we will open it up for much more efficient storage methods, this will do a lot in regards to stability and performance in the long-run.\r\nYou can track the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2792\r\n\r\n### 🔧 (TBD) Changes to the config system and perhaps a reload command\r\nWe haven't fully decided on this one yet but you can follow the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2822\r\n\r\n### 💡 (TBD) Cargo networks rewrite\r\nWhere do we even start here... It needs a rewrite, nuff said.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🎉 Feedback\r\nWe are always looking for feedback!\r\nIf you have something to suggest, check out our discord server @ https://discord.gg/slimefun and visit `#suggestions`.\r\nWe are always eager to see what the community wants or doesn't want.\r\nIf you are a developer and have questions or concerns regarding some of the more technical changes, simply post your question in `#programming-help` and we will get back to you!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3170/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3090","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3090/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3090/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3090/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3090","id":906599987,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MDY1OTk5ODc=","number":3090,"title":"I have encountered problems with reloading worlds","user":{"login":"xSavior-of-God","id":66216419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjE2NDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66216419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xSavior-of-God","html_url":"https://github.com/xSavior-of-God","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xSavior-of-God/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xSavior-of-God/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xSavior-of-God/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xSavior-of-God/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xSavior-of-God/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xSavior-of-God/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xSavior-of-God/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xSavior-of-God/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xSavior-of-God/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"🐞 Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2629433731,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjI5NDMzNzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%8E%AF%20Needs%20testing","name":"🎯 Needs testing","color":"41CF62","default":false,"description":"This Issue needs to be tested by our team to see if it can be reproduced."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2021-05-30T01:36:06Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T18:21:46Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### ❗ Checklist\n\n- [X] I am using the official english version of Slimefun and did not modify the jar.\n- [X] I am using an up to date \"DEV\" (not \"RC\") version of Slimefun.\n- [X] I am aware that issues related to Slimefun addons need to be reported on their bug trackers and not here.\n- [X] I searched for similar open issues and could not find an existing bug report on this.\n\n### 📍 Description\n\nHi, I'll go to the point, I'm trying to create a multi world skyblock, so each island has a world saved on a database, so as to save space on the main machine...\r\n\r\nIn doing this I encountered a problem, being that I unload the worlds after starting 2 minutes later, I have encountered problems with duplication of locations or lack of unloading of networks (which appeared to be duplicates), or that some machines no longer work .. I was wondering if there is a way to unload the various slimefun blocks, instead of just saving them, as happens now.\r\n\r\nOr a help where you simply tell me mainly the classes that I should touch/look at in order to understand how to fix the problem... for now I have tried to fix the networks, I actually managed to do it, at least that's what I hoped for... but the problem persists...\r\n\r\n\r\n(I solved the problem of networks by unloading them when the world is unloaded (onWorldUnload event), using the method provided)\n\n### 📑 Reproduction Steps\n\nto reproduce this problem you need 1 plugin that allows you to Unloose and load worlds (like SlimeWorld or MultiverseCore)\r\n\r\n1) at startup place slimefun blocks in a new world (not the main one!), create 1 network (cargo or Energy) and the furnaces that generate electricity (i.e. the head)\r\n\r\n2) Unload the world with /mv unload worldName or /swm unload worldName (make sure there is nobody in this world when you do these commands!)\r\n\r\n3) Wait a few minutes and reload the world with /mv load worldName or /swm load worldName.\n\n### 💡 Expected Behavior\n\ndepends on what you place, I found errors in the console (in the case of the furnaces that generate electricity, due to lack of network) or simply the various blocks stop working properly (since are duplicated, or unusable due to the existence of a duplicate router)\n\n### 📷 Screenshots / Videos\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📜 Server Log\n\n_No response_\n\n### 📂 `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### 💻 Server Software\n\nYatopia\n\n### 🎮 Minecraft Version\n\n1.16.x\n\n### ⭐ Slimefun version\n\nI use a recoding of the v4.9 \n\n### 🧭 Other plugins\n\nAdvancedSlimeWorldManager","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3090/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076","id":899857016,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4OTk4NTcwMTY=","number":3076,"title":"Slimefun and PyroMining incompatibility ","user":{"login":"ItsSynchro","id":16171807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTcxODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16171807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro","html_url":"https://github.com/ItsSynchro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"🐞 Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2629433731,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjI5NDMzNzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%8E%AF%20Needs%20testing","name":"🎯 Needs testing","color":"41CF62","default":false,"description":"This Issue needs to be tested by our team to see if it can be reproduced."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2021-05-24T17:24:36Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T18:21:46Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"<!-- FILL IN THE FORM BELOW -->\r\n\r\n## :round_pushpin: Description (REQUIRED)\r\n<!-- A clear and detailed description of what went wrong. -->\r\n<!-- The more information you can provide, the easier we can handle this problem. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\nUpon using PyroMining and Slimefun, individuals are able to obtain PyroMining items if they break ores with a pickaxe that they don't have researched.

Observe how items are transferred into the destroyed Electric Furnace and are destroyed immediately afterwards as the TickerTask processes the removal of the Electric Furnace \r\n\r\nFrom my testing this is a very rare occasion, and as such a very hard bug to reproduce.\r\nHowever, with the help of a debugger which is capable of pausing the async TickerTask, it is reproducible every time\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nThe item does not transfer, or drops in the world\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n - Minecraft Version: v1_15_R1\r\n - Slimefun Version: DEV 489 (git d8964)\r\n - CS-CoreLib Version: v1.6.3\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121","id":204901222,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDQ5MDEyMjI=","number":121,"title":"Cargo Input Nodes don't transfer whitelisted Items if not-whitelisted items come first","user":{"login":"BlackBeltPanda","id":5866087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjYwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5866087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda","html_url":"https://github.com/BlackBeltPanda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"🐞 Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2642156940,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjQyMTU2OTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%A7%A8%20Confirmed%20Bug","name":"🧨 Confirmed Bug","color":"B3EFFA","default":false,"description":"This bug has been confirmed by our team."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2017-02-02T15:12:02Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T02:49:40Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Description\r\nWith an Input Node in Blacklist mode and no items blacklisted, connected to a chest with an Advanced Output Node with an item whitelisted, if any items are blocking the slots before the whitelisted item in the input chest with nowhere to go, the whitelisted item never gets transported.\r\n\r\n## Evidence / Proof\r\nGIF: https://i.gyazo.com/7199e6c7f7e7f173fa3c7f1dfa778efc.gif\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nMC version: 1.11.2 (git-Paper-1032)\r\nCS-CoreLib version: 1.5.12\r\nSlimefun version: 4.1.1\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}]
